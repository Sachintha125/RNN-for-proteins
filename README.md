# RNN-for-proteins
Bi-LSTM for binary classification of proteins 
The objective of this application program is to to classify protein sequences as Ubiquitin-transferease and non-Ubiquitin transferase (binary classification) through a machine learning approach. This software is capable of classifying sequences that have maximum length of 1000 amino acids. The software can take input as fasta file that contain even multiple fasta records and parse the records, perform feature selection, vectorization and perform the binary classification of each vectorized sequence using trained model.
